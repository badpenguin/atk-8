ATK HISTORY
===========

ATK Framework was started by [iBuildings](https://ibuildings.nl/) who developed until [V7.0](https://github.com/ibuildingsnl/ATK)

After iBuildings stopped development all the resources were handed over to [Sintattica](https://www.sintattica.it/)  

Sintattica updated by adding some functionality and fixing bugs creating 2 new versions of ATK
[V8 and V9](https://github.com/Sintattica/atk)

V8 has reached V8.2.7 and was last updated April 2017. V8 is backward compatible but only runs on PHP 5.6 or earlier

V9 has reached V9.1 and was last updated March 2019. V9 is NOT backward compatible

BadPenguin forked Sintattica V8.2.7 and created [V8.2.8](https://github.com/badpenguin/atk-8)
updating with his own patches.  Last update July 2019. "It works in production with PHP 5.5, 5.6  and PHP 7.0"

I needed ATK V8.5 is BadPenguins V8.2.8 with updates to enable it to run under PHP 7.4 WITHOUT any PHP Warnings or Notices

More use may cause additional Warnings or Notices - my intention is to also fix any found

I will also add some extra patches for some additional functionality that I have used in earlier versions

Feedback / Patches appreciated

 

ATK Framework
=============
The ATK Framework is a special purpose PHP framework targeted at business applications. It allows you to build an application with very small amounts of code.

Its focus on business features makes it an excellent framework for HRM, CRM, data management and CMS type applications. The ATK Framework is stable and suitable for production. For more information and support see the [ATK Community Forum](https://www.atk-framework.com/forum/) and the [ATK Wiki](http://atk-framework.com/wiki/ATK).


To Get Started
==============
Applications built using the ATK Framework can be hosted on a standard web application AMP stack (Apache/MySQL/PHP), and is compatible with current AMP stack component versions (e.g. PHP 5.5+, 7.0-7.4, MySQL/Maria 5.5/5.6). 

Download ATK 8.5.x from this repository and copy all the files to directory atk a subdirectory of your application's root folder
Then copy all files from /atk/skel to the application's root folder and configure ATK by editing config.inc.php
